const QUESTIONS = [
  {
    q: "Is Kaimana actually free?",
    a: "Yes — the whole platform. Every problem, every contest, the AI panel and the kids zone are open to any account. Gems are earned by solving problems, never bought.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which languages can I submit?",
    a: "Python, C++ and JavaScript. Each problem ships starter code shaped for the language you pick, and every submission is compiled and run by the same judge — so your runtime is comparable with everyone else's.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are gems, and what do I spend them on?",
    a: "You earn gems for accepted solutions and spend them on hints. Tier 1 is a nudge, tier 2 sketches the approach, tier 3 gets close to the answer — and unlocking one carries a small scoring penalty, so asking for help stays a real decision.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need an account?",
    a: "Yes — everything past this page is behind a free account, because every problem, verdict, gem and streak is tied to you. Signing in with Google takes one click, and you are never asked for a card.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much should I trust the Big-O auditor?",
    a: "It analyses the structure of the code you submitted and reports its time and space complexity with a confidence level and the reasoning behind it. Read the reasoning — it is there so you can check the answer rather than take it on faith.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I run a contest for my own group?",
    a: "Yes. Request a host account from the host page; once an admin approves it you get a host panel where you can create a contest, attach problems and follow the scoreboard live.",
  },
