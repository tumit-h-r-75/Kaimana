  // succeed (the POST goes through) but the cookie never actually gets
  // stored, so the very next request looks signed-out again.

  // (e.g. /api/auth/me), which next.config.ts rewrites server-side to the
  // real backend. The browser only ever talks to one origin, so the
  // cookie is first-party and persists normally. Set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
  // to override this (e.g. for local development against a backend that
  // isn't proxied).
